# printf
This is the Holberton repository for the printf project, its purpose is to contain the final files the checker is run on.

_printf is supposed to be a 1:1 copy of printf from stdio, so far, this is not the case. Currently the function supports the following specifiers:

%c: prints a character.
%s: prints a string.
%d: prints a number.
%i: prints a number.
%%: prints a % sign.
%other specifier: prints a copy of the specifier.

Otherwise, it should behave exactly as printf.
This was coded by Omar Assoudi and Omar El Ouali.
